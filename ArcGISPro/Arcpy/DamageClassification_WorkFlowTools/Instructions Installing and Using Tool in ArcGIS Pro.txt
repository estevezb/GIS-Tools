Instructions: Installing and Using the GIS Tool in ArcGIS Pro


Overview

This toolbox is provided as an ArcGIS Pro toolbox (.atbx) and a Python script (.py). It has two functionalities:
1) a python script tool athat allows users to extract 3 bands (RGB) from a raster, resample to a desired cell size, and apply NoData and 8-bit conversion. 
2) A ModelBuilder Model that combines raster reformatting script above and polygon feature class creation for cases when you will be creating manually digitized polygon samples.

Note: To function as expected the provided ModelBuilder Model requires user input for parameters including, desired output raster cell size, and changes in user folder paths and file names.


Step 1: Download the Tool Files
You should receive a .zip file containing:

MyToolbox.atbx → The ArcGIS Pro toolbox
extractBands_exportRaster.py → The Python script referenced by the tool
README.txt → These instructions

Make sure to extract the ZIP file before proceeding!

Step 2: Place the Files in a Working Directory

Copy the MyToolbox.atbx and ExtractBands.py files to a location on your computer.
Recommended Location:
C:\GIS_Tools\ExtractBands\
Ensure that the .py script stays in the same folder as the toolbox to avoid errors.

Step 3: Add the Toolbox to ArcGIS Pro

Open ArcGIS Pro.
Go to the Catalog Pane (View → Catalog Pane).
Right-click "Toolboxes" and select "Add Toolbox".
Browse to the location where you saved MyToolbox.atbx.
Select the file and click OK.
The toolbox is now available in your project!

Step 4: Run the Tool

In the Catalog Pane, expand the toolbox (MyToolbox.atbx).
Double-click the tool (e.g., "Extract 3 Bands").
Fill in the required parameters:
Input Raster → Select a .tif raster file.
Output Folder → Choose where the processed raster will be saved.
Output Raster Name → Provide a name for the final raster (no extension needed).
Click Run.

The tool will extract the RGB bands, apply NoData where necessary, and convert the raster to 8-bit unsigned format.

Step 5: Verify the Output

The processed raster will be saved in the selected output folder as a .tif file.
The new raster will automatically appear in your ArcGIS Pro map.
The NoData areas will be correctly applied, preventing black borders.


Troubleshooting
Issue: Tool is Not Visible in ArcGIS Pro
Solution: Make sure you added the toolbox correctly (Catalog Pane → Add Toolbox).

Issue: Script Not Found
Solution: Ensure extractBands_exportRaster.py is in the same folder as MyToolbox.atbx.

Issue: Output Raster is Black
Solution: The input raster may have incorrect NoData values. Make sure the input has valid pixel values.
